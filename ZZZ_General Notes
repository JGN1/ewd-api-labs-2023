Review Integration with REACT app
In order to minimse code changes I added new review.js in API folder of React app with apiAddReview method, updated moviesContext.jsx

IDEA - mustwatch could be another endpoint - IDEA
IDEA - use this in movieReviews to add mongdb reviews to end of those from TMDB API call. - setMyReviews( {...myReviews, [movie.id]: review } )


Hooked up React app to Review endpoint for POST. Can now add review from REACT app to MongoDB
via my API. Built out additional GET endpoint to search by movieID and bring back array of reviews for movie from MongDB

"Refactored my review API to use 'content' instead of 'review' for review content field This was to make compatible with React app. Also adjusted React movieReviews in React App to reach out to my API for reviews to display in app"

Changes made to React Movie app to integrate - Added stage and dev env for VITE. Can now run stage version to use my API for login and use dev version to use SUPABASE authentication. Added file rename function to copy appropriate authcontext file for each before startup of vite server (in package.json scripts). Added additional proxy path for accounts securtity token.


For Auth - using .env variable. 
   	- In component/profileIcon/index.jsx to set displayname for profile icon on top right screen
	- In Login.jsx page
    - Added in components/movieReviews/index.js for switching between retrieval of TMDB and own API reviews use 'dev' and 'stage' environments

if (import.meta.env.VITE_AUTH_API == "MONGODB") {...}
if (import.meta.env.VITE_AUTH_API == "SUPABASE") {...}
